AWS Cost Optimizer & Predictor 🚀
A fully automated AWS cost monitoring solution using S3, Lambda, CloudWatch, and Python visualization (Matplotlib/Pandas). This project extracts cost usage data, stores it in S3, processes it with Lambda, and visualizes it in Colab.

📌 Features
✔ Automated Cost Data Extraction – Uses AWS Lambda & CloudWatch to schedule daily cost report generation.
✔ Secure Storage – Cost reports are stored in an S3 bucket.
✔ Data Processing & Visualization – Python-based analysis with Matplotlib & Pandas.
✔ Cost Optimization Strategy – Can be upgraded with AWS Athena, QuickSight, or Grafana.

🛠 Architecture Overview
🚀 Free-Tier Optimized Approach (Implemented)

1️⃣ AWS Cost Explorer – Generates historical cost data (No forecasting).
2️⃣ AWS Lambda – Fetches cost data via Boto3 SDK.
3️⃣ Amazon S3 – Stores extracted reports.
4️⃣ CloudWatch Scheduler – Automates Lambda execution daily.
5️⃣ Google Colab – Processes and visualizes cost data using Python (Matplotlib, Pandas).


🔍 Alternative Approach (If Not Limited by Free Tier 💸)
If we weren’t restricted to free-tier services, we could use:

✅ AWS Athena – Query S3 cost data instead of Colab.
✅ Amazon QuickSight – Professional dashboards instead of Matplotlib.
✅ Amazon Grafana – Live visualization with AWS CloudWatch integration.
✅ AWS EC2 – Runs Python scripts directly instead of using Google Colab.

📌 How It Works
1️⃣ Setup AWS Services
Enable Cost Explorer in AWS.
Create an S3 bucket for storing cost reports.
Create an IAM role with S3 and Cost Explorer access.
2️⃣ Automate Data Collection
Deploy an AWS Lambda function to extract cost data.
Schedule Lambda execution using CloudWatch Scheduler (Daily run).
3️⃣ Process & Visualize Cost Data
Download cost reports from S3.
Use Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) for visualization in Google Colab.
📌 Deployment Guide
1️⃣ Upload Lambda Code to AWS
Install AWS SDK:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install boto3
Deploy Lambda function:
python
Copy
Edit
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client = boto3.client('ce')
    response = client.get_cost_and_usage(
        TimePeriod={'Start': '2024-03-01', 'End': '2024-03-31'},
        Granularity='DAILY',
        Metrics=['AmortizedCost']
    )
    print(response)
2️⃣ Automate Execution with CloudWatch
Create a CloudWatch Scheduler with a daily cron job:
txt
Copy
Edit
cron(0 0 * * ? *)
3️⃣ Visualize Cost Data in Google Colab
Install required Python libraries:
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Load cost data from S3 & plot graphs:
python
Copy
Edit
df = pd.read_json("s3://your-bucket-name/cost-data.json")
df.plot(kind="bar")
plt.show()

📌 Future Enhancements
✅ Athena for Querying Cost Data
✅ Grafana for Live Cost Monitoring
✅ QuickSight for Advanced Reports
✅ EC2 for Running Python Code Instead of Colab
📌 How to Delete AWS Resources & Avoid Charges?
🔴 Important! Before you leave, delete:
1️⃣ S3 bucket – Remove stored cost reports.
2️⃣ Lambda function – Stop cost retrieval scripts.
3️⃣ CloudWatch Scheduler – Stop daily execution.
4️⃣ IAM Role – Remove permissions for security.
